     “Being in the moment” is one of the most difficult things one can do. While the simplicity of the concept makes it seem like something we can all do at all times, but that is certainly far from the truth. Truthfully, being in the moment is simply hard to realize. The modern world is chaotic, constantly bombarding us with the latest and greatest, with little to no respect for the psyche of the consumer.</p>

   This is where the concept of “The Flow” comes into relevance. This philosophy is rooted in the background of experience. While this mode of thinking is uncommon in the western world, awareness of the background of experience has a history amongst Buddhist meditation practices. Specifically, the practice of “Open Monitoring”, where the meditator is able to invoke a non-judgmental perspective on experience. As you will soon come to learn, this ability to appreciate awareness comes with great benefits and can strongly strengthen the ego.</p>
   <p>The importance of the ego can be found in dreams. Carl Jung hypothesized that dreams were the unconscious self’s way of communicating with the conscious self, or the ego. He believed that dreams were a way to view the current situation of the psyche and advocated for research in the field. The research project ‘Structural Dream Analysis’ sought to investigate this hypothesis through an objective and non-biased lens. The findings from this study are further discussed in the ‘Dreams’ section of this website.</p>
   <p>The perspective dreams give us is a gift we are often too ignorant to appreciate. In our western world, someone is considered mentally ill if they act differently than those around them, or if they experience any prolonged emotional state other than contentment (exaggeration). Whereas in other, more traditional, parts of the world, such as the Amazon, mental illness is considered if someone has trouble dreaming or accessing their imagination. This alternative perspective to mental health perhaps hints at an ignorance of a deeper sense of meaning.</p>
   <p>This meaning is the very entity that “The Flow” seeks out to understand. Through deep analysis and thought, I have composed my perspective on the meaning of life. I will come to highlight the importance of the background, true mystical experiences, love, and the self. </p>
