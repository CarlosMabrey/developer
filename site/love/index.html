      <!--<p class="freeWrite">Love is a disease. It eats away at each victim, changing their chemical makeup, showing the victims of love what it means to be hurt, happy, cathartic, and euphoric all in the same moment. Love is apparent across the universe, particles tied together through quantum entanglement, feeling each other across the universe. Love is passion, passion holds the fruits of life. Love is the fruit of life. Love for one’s community, friends, for one’s hobby or significant other. Love takes many shapes, hiding itself in the crevasse of life. It hits you when you least expect it and holds on for dear life, dragging you along with it. As a disease, a miss-guided love can eat away at the heart, teaching a rampant lesson on failure and heartbreak. On the other end, the bacteria of love feed into the passion of the universe. Well-nourished love is one of the most sought-after events in the entire universe, and it is unfortunately all too rare for the human life to fully appreciate it. Love comes in many forms, good and bad, malicious and fruitful, short and long lived, but love is always teaching.</p> -->

        Love holds much more power than we are often able to appreciate. From Jesuit priest and scientist Pierre Teilhard’s perspective: “Love is the core energy of the universe.” Teilhard saw evolution as a progression towards “more being”, while materialism promotes wellbeing. The difference is that “more being” is actualized through an increase in psychic energy / consciousness (Grau 1976, p. 275. He further claimed “the consciousness of each of us is evolution looking at itself and reflecting upon itself (Teilhard de Chardin 1959, p. 221). Reflection, in this context, is defined as “the power acquired by a consciousness to turn in upon itself, to take possession of itself as an object ... no longer merely to know, but wo know that one knows” (Teilhard de Chardin 2959, p. 165). Furthermore, he posited the principal of “Omega”: that God is within everything that exists and the future of everything that exists.</p>
      <p class="quote">“As we come to a higher consciousness of unity, God rises up in us; in a sense, God becomes God in us: “All around us and within our own selves, God is in process of ‘changing,’ as a result of the coincidence of his magnetic power and our own thought” (Teilhard de Chardin 1965, p. 53).”</p>
      <p>Therefore, to open to this idea of the presence of “God” is to realize the power of love. I see parallels between Teilhard and Jung here, as Teilhard’s idea of God reflects Jung’s idea of the “collective unconscious”. Whether or not one believes in God here is irrelevant. In the context of “The Flow”, God is synonymous with the experience of love. To live a life full of compassion and love for others with a sense of selflessness is the key to “enlightenment”</p>

    <h1 class="loveCallout">Why then, in a world composed of love, must suffering exist? </h1>
    <p>Suffering brings out the entropy of the universe. To suffer is to know something is wrong. Realizing a flaw is where the very concept of growth is generated. We must suffer to love. It is a condition of existence. The limitations of our existence define our perception, and it is suffering which teaches us the significance of love. To lose these limitations is to “lose the sense of what it means to be created, dependent, contingent and finite” (Delio, 8).</p>
    <p class="quote">Every human has priceless gifts to share, and we're approaching 8 billion presents to unwrap" (Schroeder 49).</p>
    <p class="quote">“Consciousness is a fundamental property of the universe, inherited because the love that coaches us to become aware is a fundamental intention of the source consciousness which pre-exists any and every secondary thing” (Schroeder 55).</p>
