		    <p>&emsp;The authors examined the relationships between Beronsky’s identity style model and Schartz’s value theory. Value orientations are defined as beliefs about how individuals should behave. Identity styles are strategic approaches to how individuals solve problems and evaluate self-reliant information. According to the lifespan theory of psychosocial development, identity formation is prerequisite to the development of a sense of ego integrity later in adulthood. This is the very development which enables one to find meaning in their lives and understanding of other people’s perspectives. When speaking in the context of normative identity style, the author claims that traits such as homophobia stems from the value places on tradition and predictability, as well as a resistance to change. Further, the authors suggest that “these behaviors may stem from perceived threats to the institutions anchoring their lives”. Concluding, how individuals real with identity conflicts was found to be related to one’s values.</p>
		    <p>&emsp;Today it is common knowledge that differing identities contain differing values, however, it is still unknown how this process of differing values scientifically occurs within individuals. This study was able to find evidence that identity has an effect on values. The findings from this study claim identity always takes place in context and is a dynamic process. These findings are especially interesting from the perspective of “The Flow”, where identity is a result of one’s environment.</p>

            <p>&emsp;Researchers at the University of São Paulo sought to improve the process of learning through assessing Csikzentmihalyi’s Flow Theory. The researchers claim that there is a line one must find between skill level and difficulty level as to avoid anxiety or boredom. The researchers constructed a pseudo-algorithm to obtain the optimal flow level for a task’s required skill level / difficulty. This algorithm demonstrates the framework’s to ability to be integrated into the learning design process.</p>
            <p>&emsp;The findings in this article are somewhat inconclusive, however they construct a useful framework for understanding the flow state and its potential utility in education. In the context of “The Flow”, this utility could extend academic education and be manipulated into optimizing the learning experience as a whole. The pseudo-algorithm which was constructed would take the burden off of the educator to select content based on the student. It is important to note again that this study was a proposed model and not a proven law, but the authors are developing empirical studies to validate this study, which will be an exciting read.</p>

            <p>&emsp;Llia Delio, a researcher of theology and religious studies at Villanova university, takes a look at Pierre Teilhard de Chardin’s thoughts on transhumanism. This article takes a Christian perspective and seeks to understand the implications of artificial intelligence, suffering, and transhumanism. The author constructs a dual-aspect monist perspective on mind and matter, balancing a middle ground between monism and dualism. The framework claims that mind and matter are “two aspects of the same cosmic stuff”.</p>
            <p>&emsp;		For the context of “The Flow”, Delio’s perspective on suffering offers a cohesive reasoning behind suffering. While the article is a religious perspective, it offers many similar aspects of “The Flow” and goes to show how many differing disciplines have come to very similar conclusions. </p>

            <p>&emsp;The neuroscience article by Ruben R. Laukkoen and Heleen A. Slagter proposes that practicing mediation helps the meditator experience a state of pure awareness by reducing temporally deep processing. The authors outline a neurological framework of the mind, claiming that past experience is an underlying factor of all mental activity. This important theory behind the mind demonstrates how one’s thoughts generate one’s experience, hence the “predictive mind”. This distinction is where the importance of meditation shines through. Further, being in the “moment”, which meditation prepares one for, is the result of the mind ignoring it’s predictive processes and appreciating experience without judgement.  </p>
            <p>&emsp;The findings from this study suggest that meditation can be a tool used to change one’s mind and perspective. In the busy modern world, this practice is most important due to the thousands of predictive processes we are subject to. Meditation, then, poses itself as an opportunity to relieve these stresses.</p>

            <p>&emsp;The author uses several near-death experiences (NDE) to suggest that there is a difference in bodiless and body-bound consciousness. And, further, that “space-time is a derived feature subsequent to the emergence of perception of the bodiless consciousness, rather than a pre-existing and unchangeable property”. In NDEs, there are two reported perspectives of bodiless consciousness: similarity and difference. Similarity is when the NDE-ers experience a collaboration of bodiless and body-bound consciousness to piece together the “truth” of an NDE event. A sense of difference is enlisted when the NDE-er claims to be in some kind of “eternal place outside of time or space”, extending their understanding of the physical world. The author proposes that it is bodiless consciousness that triggers the collapse of a quantum state and believes there is a relationship with the bodiless consciousness and electromagnetic waves.  </p>
            <p>&emsp;The findings from this study, while seemingly overenthusiastic, suggests that the structure of the physical world is a derived property generated in the process of perception. This is a very interesting perspective with some intellectual merit. While the study may initially seem more spiritual than most other scientific studies, the opinions and evidence used is convincing and suggests some level of truth to the article. </p>

            <p>&emsp;Researchers of this article sought to provide a review on science’s current understanding of falseness and repressed memories. The review examines the range of results from varying studies, with the mean weight of false memories falling at 30%. The article also examines unconscious repressed memories, but this section is not as relevant for my scenario.</p>
            <p>&emsp;This article is useful in assessing personal knowledge and the double-edged sword of memories. The most useful part of the article is the mean suggestibility of false memories through various experiments estimated to have a mean of 30%. This will prove itself useful in my section about knowledge and the unreliability of memories.</p>

            <p>&emsp;This article is a scientific look into the sacred. Mystical Consciousness is defined as a state of mind that encompasses six categories: unit, transcendence of time and space, intuitive knowledge, sacredness, deeply felt positive mood, and ineffability and paradoxicality. The author discusses the conditions necessary to create this state of mystical consciousness, including the importance of dosage, set, and setting. The implications of administering entheogens were only at worry when a person possesses severe mental illnesses, namely psychosis. The author believes that as we begin to understand the quantum world more and reduce the importance of traditional observable reality, entheogens will provide a resource not only to religious scholars, but scientists as well.</p>
            <p>&emsp;This article is important for deconstructing the spiritual differences in the east and the west. It was found that both perspectives are able to endure an individual or united mystical experience, despite the cultural differences of the groups. These entheogens offer a lens into the ritualistic meaning behind ancient practices and sacraments, as well as potential ties to science as well. </p>

            <p>&emsp;The author, Christian Roesler conducted the research method “Structural Dream Analysis” in attempt to objectively analyze the meaning of dreams for patients active in Jungian psychotherapies. The analysis method was designed to find the relationship between the dream ego and figures within the dream. The study was able to successfully identify five dream patterns that were parallel to the condition of the psyche. During successful psychotherapy sessions, an improvement in psychological structure and health also fostered a transformation in the structure of dreams. </p>
            <p>&emsp;The findings from this study offer a powerful introspection into the importance of dreams and their relationship with mental health. It also provides an understanding of the unconscious ego, suggesting the utility behind dreaming. This study has helped me to form my own understanding of dreams and their perspective in my overall perspective. Dreams appear to be the form of communication the unconscious ego uses to communicate with the conscious ego. Previously, I had no theories or opinions on dreaming, likely because dreams aren’t a significant part of my experience; I don’t dream.</p>

EBSCOhost, search-ebscohost-com.ezproxy2.library.colostate.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=cookie,ip,url,cpid&custid=s4640792&db=aph&AN=143293387&site=ehost-live.</p>
            <p>&emsp;This discussion paper follows author Carl Johan Schroeder’s life work on his theories of consciousness. The author immediately distinguishes his spiritual psychology as complete, because being complete would inhibit the growth and understanding of the potential of consciousness. He claims the goal of life is enrichment and offering solutions to threats, defined as “negativity, willful ignorance, blocked growth, and disconnection from the transcendent compassionate source of self”. He had a spiritual awakening when attempting to meditate in front of his computer and “channel” the code from his meditation. Instead, he found himself typing theology and experienced a strong sense of love and inspired energy – his life changed overnight. Schroeder argues that “consciousness itself is a fundamental property of the universe, as indivisibly primal as the physical properties of space, time, and mass”. Further, the purpose of everything is to promote more consciousness and unleash powerful thoughts, feelings, and inspirations. He asserts that time and space are one simultaneous entity, causing one to be less the product of evolution; instead, evolution becomes the product of you. The author uses this understanding of space-time to highlight the opportunity for consciousness to be aware of itself and develop indefinitely. The reason for this indefinite development is to endlessly increase love. “Love is the being and doing that makes realities real, and consciousness becomes key to enlivening the universe with increasing appreciation to join in the design.” Schroeder believes that dreams should be beneficial even if forgotten. For him, allowing and trusting in himself to fully be his unconscious mind during dream states has vastly increased his levels of gratitude. He also argues that the western scientist’s way of describing things is not always the most appropriate. He gives an example: a western scientist would explain the flow of water with gravity and fluid dynamics just as a western scientist would explain love with hormonal levels. </p>
            <p>&emsp;The author claims that he has been told his views align with Jung’s archetypes and Richard Schwart’s Internal Family Model, which have both independently been cited in my studies. The findings in this article are very influential and, in many ways, parallel to the ideas and concepts of “The Flow”. </p>
