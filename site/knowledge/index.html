    <blockquote class="quote">"All I know, is that I know nothing."</blockquote>

    <h1 class="knowledgeCallout">How Do We Know What We Know?</h1>
    <p>This is the very question the branch of philosophy, epistemology, seeks out to answer. While to the naked eye the question may seem baron and simple, introspection on the subject offers a unique perspective on the thinker. One may argue that they know what they know because they learned it from the world at some point, ex. language. But how then, do we as a species know and understand human language?</p>

    <h1 class="knowledgeCallout">Individual Vs. Societal Knowledge</h1>
    <p>I remember grading my first assignment in high school Philosophy. The question was something to the extent of Ayn Rand’s perspective on epistemology, but my answer instead offered my own perspective. I don’t remember the question, but my response was something along the lines of: </p>
    <blockquote class="quote">“Man did not create the laws of the universe, we only discovered them. Why then, do we act as if we fundamentally inscribed these laws into existence? We do not have any power over what we know, no authority over the capital T “Truth”. Therefore, we can not know anything because to know something as absolute is to bring that thing into existence.” </blockquote>
    <p>I was marked wrong, but this was an important moment in my perspective on school. I knew that my answer contained great substance, yet because it did not fit Ayn Rand’s perspective on the topic, my answer received no merit. I was okay with being marked incorrect, because it reminded me of the conformity of thought within education. In retrospect, I should have answered from Ayn Rand's perspective (I was learning!) for the sake of the assignment, but I had my own agenda. I was both (individually) right and (societally) wrong. The point of this this story is this: knowledge is subjective, and a wise (hu)man knows how to balance knowledge with context. </p>

    <h1 class="knowledgeCallout">What is the Purpose of Knowledge?</h1>
    <p>We have established that knowledge is a subjective trait of the observer, but what is the purpose of it? Knowledge is the collective series of ideas, perspective, and experience of an observer. This knowledge is used as a means for the universe to understand itself. Remember that however crazy life may be, human experience is tied to the mysticism of the universe. While people like to ponder and question the universe, we must remember that we are also inclusive of it. We do not extend the bounds of the universe, in fact, we are formed by the restrictiveness of the human body.</p>
