    <h1 class="truthCallout">Capital T "Truth"</h1>
    <p>The world would be much simpler if there was some form of divine, capital T Truth all humans had access to. Unfortunately, we live in a world of subjective lower-case truths and must come to find our sense of truth from our individual journeys. Every person you could talk to would offer you some differing perspective of truth, depending on the context. Does this mean then, that there exists no form of capital T Truth?</p>

    <h1 class="truthCallout">Is Math the Closes Thing to Truth?</h1>
    <p>Math is a subject most humans are introduced to, but few are able to realize the depth and importance of. I vividly remember the wonder and confusion that flowed over myself sitting in my 3rd grade music class when my teacher told the class “everything was made of math”. This same teacher ended up teaching me how to use programs like Excel and Gmail as I developed, and I eventually interned at his company Piano Marvel when I was 16. All of his own children were on the verge of genius and understood some fundamental part of the world that most people simply did not. While any opinion outside of their own can only be classified as speculation, I attribute their connection to the world with their strongly rooted connection with math and music. </p>
    <p>You may have found in your own experience that often times the people with the most interesting mystical and spiritual interpretations of the world are also mathematicians. Not all, of course. Many individuals with heavy influence in science dissolve their sense of spirituality, but it is the outliers I am concerned with here. People who are skilled in math have an innate understanding of the operations of the world. After all, this is what math truly is. Math is the “Truth” of the universe, the one thing we know can not faulter under development (such as our changing understanding of biology). Math only builds upon itself, and is the forerunner of the great innovations of the world.</p>

    <h1 class="truthCallout">What About the Observable World?</h1>
    <p>It is indisputable among an observer that the world exists, but that does not imply the world is constructed with Truths. </p>
    <p>"Blocktime" is defined at the post-Einsteinian view that all time is simultaneous. Instead of the traditional viewpoint, here, the universe is ever-expanding block of spacetime originating from the big bang. This was a theory postulated from Einstein himself, in response to Michelson-Morley’s discovery that the speed of light is the same in all directions for all observers, regardless of how fast the observer is going {Schroeder 51}.</p>

    <h1 class="truthCallout">Personal Truth</h1>
    <p>Autistic savant, Daniel Tammet, can solve extraordinarily complex math problems and questions in his head. When he described what his experience was like, he explained that numbers were his friends and he doesn’t use math at all. To Daniel, every number contains a synesthetic personality. “To calculate a combination of numbers, Daniel sees each number as a creature and then watches them mate” (Schroeder 56). He also set the world record for reciting Pi, describing it as “a beautiful planet and described the experience of reading Pi like “taking a lovely stroll through and otherworldly garden, describing the sights and sounds of his number friends in passing.”</p>
    <p>The weight of this ability can only really be assessed if one knows the weight of Pi. Pi is an extremely important concept for the development of the human race, signifying the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. In other words, Pi is the ratio that turns a line into a circle. What then does it mean for Daniel to recite Pi, a mathematical rationalization of a perfect circle? Pi is a nonrepeating infinite number which theoretically contains every pattern of the universe, (potentially) including the thoughts running through your mind as you explore this exact place on the internet.</p>
    <p>To bring this into context, the truth individuals construct in attempt to understand the world is incomplete. This does not mean individual experience is not true, rather, it is a subset of the Truth. Each individual perspective offers its own framework of the universe, allowing the universe to observe itself in a objective, holistic way. Instead of living in a state of anxiety over the unknown, take comfort in the fact that the universe would not be True without your truth.</p>
